The primary author and principal contributor to this thesis is Casper Norrbin. Casper independently developed all sections, except Section~\ref{sec:background}, which was collaboratively authored with Niclas Gärds and Joel Sikström. Both Niclas and Joel pursued their theses in parallel with this one, with Joel focusing on adapting the two-level segregated fit allocator~\cite{joel} and Niclas on integrating an allocator into ZGC~\cite{niclas}. Joel's work resulted in distinct adaptations and outcomes, while Niclas explored the challenges and opportunities of integrating an allocator into ZGC, a natural extension of both this work and Joel's research.

For the section developed in collaboration with Niclas and Casper, the contributions are: Sections~\ref{sec:memory_management},~\ref{sec:fragmentation} and~\ref{sec:memory_allocation} are authored solely by Joel, Sections~\ref{sec:gc} and~\ref{sec:openjdk} are authored solely by Casper, and Section~\ref{sec:zgc} is authored solely by Niclas.
