The primary delimitation of this thesis is the exclusion of allocator integration within ZGC. The focus will be on examining the allocators and their adaptations independently. Additionally, the modifications will focus solely on small pages in ZGC, as these are the most common. Consideration of medium and large pages has been excluded from this thesis. However, insights gained from small pages may guide potential adaptations for medium and possibly large pages.
