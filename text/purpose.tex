The purpose of this thesis is to investigate potential adaptations to an existing free-list-based allocator for integration with ZGC and to implement and evaluate these modifications. The results of these modifications offer insight into the functionality of a free-list-based allocator in ZGC and its potential behavior. The goal is to leverage these insights to direct subsequent efforts in the domain of free-list-based allocators in garbage collection.

The questions this thesis seeks to answer are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What considerations need to be made when adapting an allocator for use within ZGC?
  \item How can these considerations be used to implement adaptations to a free-list-based allocator to improve its performance and/or memory efficiency?
\end{enumerate}
