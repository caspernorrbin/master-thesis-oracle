Each buddy system corresponds to a set of recurrence relations which relate the block sizes provided to each other. Analyses of the internal fragmentation of the binary buddy system, the Fibonacci buddy system, and the weighted buddy system are given. Comparative simulation results are also presented for internal, external, and total fragmentation.},

abstract = {The hierarchical memory system with increasingly small and increasingly fast memory closer to the CPU has for long been at the heart of hiding, or mitigating the performance gap between memories and processors. To utilise this hardware, programs must be written to exhibit good object locality. In languages like C/C++, programmers can carefully plan how objects should be laid out (albeit time consuming and error-prone); for managed languages, especially ones with moving garbage collectors, a manually created optimal layout may be destroyed in the process of object relocation. For managed languages that present an abstract view of memory, the solution lies in making the garbage collector aware of object locality, and strive to achieve and maintain good locality, even in the face of multi-phased programs that exhibit different behaviour across different phases. This paper presents a GC design that dynamically reorganises objects in the order mutators access them, and additionally strives to separate frequently and infrequently used objects in memory. This improves locality and the efficiency of hardware prefetching. Identifying frequently used objects is done at run-time, with small overhead. HCSGC also offers tunability, for shifting relocation work towards mutators, or for more or less aggressive object relocation. The ideas are evaluated in the context of the ZGC collector on OpenJDK and yields performance improvements of 5\% (tradebeans), 9\% (h2) and an impressive 25–45\% (JGraphT), all with 95\% confidence. For SPECjbb, results are inconclusive due to a fluctuating baseline.},

   abstract = {Designing good digital experiences for children can be difficult; designers have to consider children's cognitive and motor skill limitations, understand their target audience, create something entertaining and educational, comply with national and international jurisdiction, and at the same time appeal to parents. We set out to create a general framework which designers and developers can use as a foundation and testing ground for their digital products in the field of user experience. The methods used during the thesis include interviews, literature studies, user testing, case studies, personas, prototyping, and more. The results created are primarily user experience guidelines packaged in a Theoretical Framework, user testing conclusions, along with suggestions on improving the current Lego Star Wars: Force Builders application, a few in the form of prototypes. },

   abstract = {Storytelling has been a part of human culture ever since we gained the ability to speak. Telling stories is a way to entertain, pass along knowledge, and present moral dilemmas. Today, many people choose to enjoy stories by listening to audiobooks. With a technique called gamification, engagement in storytelling can be increased by adding certain game elements. In this report DreamScape is presented. DreamScape was created to make it easy for people to create, share, and engage in storytelling. On the DreamScape web application, users can create multiple choice stories that can have different endings. The stories are listened to on the accompanying mobile application were users can control the course of the story through voice commands. A level of gamification was added in the aspects of meaningful choice and the user being able to explore the different outcomes of the stories. When evaluating DreamScape with user tests, some participants had difficulties creating or listening to a story. This indicated that the user-friendliness could be improved. Despite this, they managed to create and listen to a story proving that our goal of creating a storytelling platform was achieved. },
